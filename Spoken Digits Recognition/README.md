Before you begin, you need to unzip `spoken_numbers.7z`. It contains all the data we will use, which comes from [Pannous.net](pannous.net/spoken_numbers.zip). Also, if you don't want to pre-process the data yourself, you must unzip `X_train.7z` from the `np_mfcc` folder. It contains the data in `numpy` arrays, needed for the training.
